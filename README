== Installation ==

Install by cloning into

  ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/JSLINT.tmbundle

== TextMate & rvm ==

It is possible to create an environment for rvm in textmate by following the
instructions on:

  https://rvm.io/integration/textmate/

the TM_RUBY will then be used automatically by the bundle. Otherwise the 
system ruby will be used.

== Syntax highlighting support ==

the gem 'coderay' can be used (optionally) to highlight code.

== .jslintrc support ==

This bundle supports using '~/.jslintrc'. Recommended Settings:

  /*jslint infixin: true, nomen:true, sloppy: true, vars: true, white: true, forin: true, plusplus: true, continue: true, bitwise: true */

== References & Attributions ==

Note: infixin is a custom setting disabling the 'in' operator checks.

* Uses Jquery and Jquery-ui

The bundle uses rspec and guard for development. The requires gems can be
installed by bundler with the supplied Gemfile.
